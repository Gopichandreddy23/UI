                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Avula Gopichand Reddy, a student passionate about becoming a Java Full Stack 
                    Developer. I possess skills to handle both the front-end and back-end aspects of web applications using Java technologies. I am proficient in front-end development with tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Angular or React. On the back-end, I leverage Java, along with Spring Boot and Hibernate, to create robust and scalable server-side applications. Additionally, I have a strong understanding of databases, both relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL), which allows me to manage and manipulate data effectively.

                    Java Full Stack Developers are adept at integrating different components of a web application, ensuring smooth communication between the client-side and server-side. Familiarity with version control systems like Git helps in managing code changes and collaboration. My role involves not just coding but also designing and architecting solutions, problem-solving, and maintaining applications.
                    
                    On the other hand, as a SQL Developer, I specialize in designing, implementing, and managing databases. I write complex SQL queries to interact with databases, performing tasks such as data extraction. SQL Developers are experts in database design, normalization, indexing, and optimization to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage. We work closely with other developers to integrate databases with applications, ensuring data integrity and security. We also create and manage stored procedures, triggers, and functions to automate repetitive tasks. Proficiency in SQL and understanding the intricacies of database management systems like Oracle or MySQL is crucial.
                    
                    I love creating projects that solve real-world problems and learning new technologies.
